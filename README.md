## About

ℹ️ This is a Netflix clone with IMDb API integration, and some Stripe magic for subscriptions

- Movie trailers when you click on thumbnails / more info
- About movie popup

## 💻 What did I use?

* Next.js
* IMDb  (movies data)
* TailwindCSS
* TypeScript

* Recoil.js (state management)
* ReactPlayer (video players)
