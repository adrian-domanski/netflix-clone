# just another Netflix clone app 🤷

## About

ℹ️ This is a Netflix clone with IMDb API integration, and some Stripe magic for subscriptions

So far I've created:
- Netflix home page (I mean it's similar 😅)
- IMDb API integration

## 💻 What did I use?

* Next.js
* IMDb for movies data
* TailwindCSS
* TypeScript

## 👉 Open [netflix.clone.app](https://my-clon-netflix.vercel.app/) to view it in the browser.
